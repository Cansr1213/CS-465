SNHU/CS-46 Full Stack Development



Architecture


In this project, I used a mix of frontend development methods: Express HTML, standard JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) approach. The admin side relied more on traditional Express-rendered HTML and JavaScript for simplicity and clear data management. On the customer side, I used SPA techniques to make the experience smoother and more responsive, updating parts of the page dynamically without full reloads.

The backend was built using a NoSQL MongoDB database. MongoDBâ€™s flexible, document-based structure made it easy to store different types of data without a rigid schema. This flexibility helped a lot as the app evolved, and it made scaling simpler as new features were added.

Functionality


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format, different from JavaScript itself, designed specifically for data storage and transfer. It connects the frontend and backend by structuring the data exchanged between them. For example, when a user submits a form on the site, that information is sent to the backend in JSON format to be processed and stored.

Throughout the build, I refactored code to improve functionality and make the app more efficient. I created reusable UI components like forms, buttons, and navigation bars instead of rewriting code multiple times. Reusable components sped up development, kept the code cleaner, and made future updates much easier.

Testing


Testing the application involved sending different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to confirm that each API endpoint worked properly. Security features like admin authentication added extra testing steps to ensure endpoints were protected and required valid credentials. Understanding request methods, endpoints, and security is essential in a full stack app because they control how users and the system safely exchange data.

Reflection



This course helped me make real progress toward my professional goals. I learned how to design and build a full stack web application, manage both the frontend and backend, and apply security practices like authentication. I also developed important personal skills: I learned the value of patience and the need to work carefully, especially when debugging complex systems. Taking the time to slow down, review my work, and troubleshoot step-by-step made a big difference in the quality of the final project.

Altogether, I built stronger technical skills in Express.js, MongoDB, API development, security, and frontend design. I also built better habits for professional work. These skills and experiences make me a stronger and more marketable candidate as I move forward in my career.
